1. What is the purpose of useState in React?
Ans:- useState is a hook that lets functional components keep track of state. 
Before hooks, only class components could manage state. 
With useState, you can have local state right in your functional components, making your code cleaner and easier to understand.

2. How do you initialize state in a functional component using useState?
Ans:- To setup state in a functional component with useState, you just call the function and give it an initial value. 
It gives you back two things: the current state value and a function to update that value.
Example: const [value, setValue] = useState(0)

4. Explain the difference between using useState in functional components vs using this.useState in class components.
Ans:- When you use useState in a functional component, you get to manage a state in a simpler way.
Each piece of state is handled seperately, and you can update it directly.
On the otherhand, with class components, you deal with this.setState , which merges new state with the old one.
This can make things a bit trickier, especially if you have multiple state variables.
Overall, functional components with hooks tend to lead to cleaner and more straightforward code.
